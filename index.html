			I am Allan John, currently living in the greater Philadelphia area. I Currently work in a retail store at Walgreens/Pharmacy. I enjoy my job helping customers and try my best to resolve their issues and promote customers experience at my current employment. I have always wanted to learn the web technology. Recently, the way web technology has evolved and became more user friendly. I was amazed by observing the new trends in website technology and what you can do with it is so appealing. Although, I was always wanted to learn this technology and build websites myself, I wasn't aware of that Coding boot camps were offering these front end and backend web technology courses. At New York Code + Design Academy where they offer one of the widely used backend technology like RUBY programming language which grew my interest to coding school and register for WDI program with NYCDA.
